# Working on ios-sweet

- Read `NOTES.md` before starting; it contains the project goal, hardware facts,
  current blocker, local artifact locations and the next concrete action.
- The user switches agents frequently. Update the active handoff in `NOTES.md`
  after each milestone and before stopping. Record commits, CI run IDs, exact
  build/boot results and unfinished work. Distinguish observations from guesses.
- Commit completed changes. Use `gh` for GitHub Actions kernel builds and logs.
  Local single-file cross-compiles are useful before spending a CI run.
- Before each temporary boot, compare the new kernel and boot image against the
  previous build and verify the intended change in the compiled code (a new
  call, diagnostic, or changed instructions/constants). Byte differences or a
  matching checksum alone do not prove the change was applied. Confirm the boot
  payload contains the selected kernel. `tools/compare-builds.py` can check added
  calls/strings and payload segments; record this evidence in the handoff.
- Device bring-up uses temporary `fastboot boot` images. Preserve the Android
  installation and partition backups. The user approved (2026-10-15) using
  internal UFS for iOS and said Android may be deleted: the iOS root goes
  into the existing `userdata` partition (no GPT changes). Keep bootloaders,
  recovery, modem, persist and the backups intact, and confirm each
  destructive step with the user before running it.
- Keep device dumps, serial numbers and downloaded Apple artifacts out of git.
